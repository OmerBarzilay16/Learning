Pod - the smallest component in k8 , logical host that run onr or more containers

Service - component that defines a stable network endpoint to access one or more Pods
types:
ClusterIP (default)	Exposes the Service internally within the cluster only.
NodePort	Exposes the Service on a static port on each Node’s IP.
LoadBalancer	Provisions an external load balancer (e.g., on cloud providers).
ExternalName	Maps the Service to an external DNS name (no selector).

ConfigMap - a resource used to store configuration data as key-value pairs

Secret - like ConfigMap but for sensetive data (Base64)

Ingress - an API object that manages external access to services in a cluster — typically HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

Volumes -  a storage unit that is accessible to containers in a Pod. Volumes are used to store data that persists 
across container restarts or is shared between containers in the same Pod.

Deployment - high-level API object that manages a set of identical Pods, provides self-healing, 
and supports rolling updates and rollbacks.

StatefulSet - Kubernetes controller used to manage stateful, ordered, and uniquely identified Pods.
Unlike a Deployment (which creates interchangeable Pods)
